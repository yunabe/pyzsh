The latest version of this META-FAQ can be found at any of the FTP sites
listed below.

Author
------

Zsh was originally written by Paul Falstad <pf@zsh.org>.
Zsh is now maintained by the members of the zsh-workers mailing
list <zsh-workers@zsh.org>.  The development is currently
coordinated by Peter Stephenson <pws@zsh.org>.  The coordinator
can be contacted at <coordinator@zsh.org>, but matters relating to
the code should generally go to the mailing list.

sites are kept frequently up to date.  The sites marked with (H) may be

The Zsh FAQ
-----------

Zsh has a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), maintained by
Peter Stephenson <pws@zsh.org>.  It is regularly posted to the
newsgroup comp.unix.shell and the zsh-announce mailing list.
The latest version can be found at any of the Zsh FTP sites, or at
http://www.zsh.org/FAQ/.  The contact address for FAQ-related matters
is <faqmaster@zsh.org>.

The Zsh Web Page
----------------

Zsh has a web page which is located at http://www.zsh.org/.  This is
maintained by Karsten Thygesen <karthy@zsh.org>, of SunSITE Denmark.
The contact address for web-related matters is <webmaster@zsh.org>.

The Zsh Userguide
-----------------

A userguide is currently in preparation.  It is intended to complement the
manual, with explanations and hints on issues where the manual can be
cabbalistic, hierographic, or downright mystifying (for example, the word
`hierographic' does not exist).  It can be viewed in its current state at
http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Guide/.  At the time of writing, chapters
dealing with startup files and their contents and the new completion system
were essentially complete.

The Zsh Wiki
------------

A `wiki' website for zsh has been created at http://www.zshwiki.org/.
This is a site which can be added to and modified directly by users without
any special permission.  You can add your own zsh tips and configurations.
